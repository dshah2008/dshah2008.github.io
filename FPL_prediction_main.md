# Player Performance Prediction - English Premier League Football  
<br/><br/>
### A. Overview
\
**Use Case**\
Predict the total points accumulated by each player in the next 5 gameweeks.\
\
**Objective** \
I have an immense passion for football(soccer) and I'm eager to improve my understanding of the game with the help of Machine Learning. I'm looking to develop my skillset in Deep Learning and Forecasting, and eventually contribute towards the increasing use of AI in the multi-billion dollar football industry.\
\
With this project, over multiple cycles, I plan to develop state-of-the-art models that can accurately forecast player performance multiple timesteps into the future. In this first version, I have developed a model that predicts the average points scored in the next five games for every player. The model is a deep neural network that combines several LSTM and fully-connected layers.\
\
**Background & Data Source** \
Over the past few years, football teams globally have spent millions to analyze games and develop strategies using AI. Companies such as Opta help these football clubs collect and aggregate match data. Their data is publicly available via the Fantasy Premier League game on https://fantasy.premierleague.com/. Several developers have maintained GitHub repositories that scrape weekly match data weekly from the game's website.\
\
For this project, I have used the https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League repository as my data source. It contains several data tables including player performance data for every match played in the last 6 years, as well as data describing players, teams and fixtures.\
\
**Other works** \
Several solutions do exist, predicting player performance using similar data sources. However, most of these approaches use bagging or boosting-based regression models. They do not leverage time series information which is critical for capturing patterns in player form and they do not predict more than one timestep into the future. They also do not use Deep Learning despite the high variance and complexity in the data.

### B. Solution

Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo. 

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
