# Player Performance Prediction - English Premier League Football  
<br/><br/>
### A. Overview
\
**Use Case**\
Predict the total points accumulated by each player in the next 5 gameweeks.\
\
**Objective** \
I have an immense passion for football(soccer) and I am eager to improve my understanding of the game with the help of Machine Learning. I am also looking to develop my skillset in Deep Learning and Forecasting, and eventually contribute towards the increasing use of AI in this multi-billion dollar industry.\
\
With this project, over multiple cycles, I plan to develop state-of-the-art models that can accurately forecast player performance multiple timesteps into the future. In this first version, I have developed a model that predicts the average points scored in the next five games for every player. The model is a deep neural network that combines several LSTM and fully-connected layers and leverages both time series and categorical features at different stages.\
\
**Background** \
Over the past few years, football teams globally have spent millions to analyze games and develop strategies using AI. Companies such as Opta help these football clubs by collecing and aggregating match data and making it publicly available via the Fantasy Premier League game on www.premierleague.com. Several developers have also maintained GitHub repositories that scrape weekly match data weekly from the website. For this project, I have used the https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League repository as my data source.

### B. Solution

Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo. 

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
